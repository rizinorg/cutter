The best way is to check the opened issues [here](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/issues) or discuss with radareorg team.
Please follow our contribution guidelines: https://cutter.re/docs/dev-doc.html

## Contributing to the documentation

The documentation is something important for newcomers. As of today the documentation can be found [here](https://cutter.re/docs/) and it stands in the [docs](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/tree/master/docs) folder.
The API Reference is automatically generated from the source code, so it is strongly advised to document your code.
Check issues marked as "Documentation" on our issues [list](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation).
